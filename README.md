# Remote-IDE
This project supports C, C++, Java. It contains a code editor and input and output console. We need to provide the ip address and port of the server to execute it.
It can suppport multiple clients. I have tested it for upto 10 clients.

## Execution

    Client : Compile and Run ideclient.java
    Server : Compile and Run server.java

Try to alter firewall if connection is refused.
